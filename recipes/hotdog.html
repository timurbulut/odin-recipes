        <p>Frankfurters are only really good when you're a kid. Once you grow up those horribly processed, pink slime tubes just taste like sweat. <strong>I'll just take a regularly processed tube of meat</strong>, thanks.</p>
        <h2>You will need:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Frying pan with lid</li>
            <li>6 Bratwurst sausages</li>
            <li>1 onion, sliced</li>
            <li>Good lager or beer</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Fry brats in some oil for about 5 mins, turning frequently. We just want a little browning.</li>
            <li>Take those brats out, toss in the onion and fry till golden and translucent.</li>
            <li>Add those brats right back in, sprinkling in a bit of salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Pour lager over, enough to halfway submerge the brats. Turn heat down to a gentle simmer.</li>
            <li>Simmer for about 12 minutes, then they should be done. If the sausages split, who cares? It's only you eating it</li>
            <li>Put those sausages in their buns, layer the onion on top, add any desired sauces.</li>
            <li>Don't forget to down that beer. Don't let it go to waste</li>
        </ol>
