        <p>I love me some burgers. I also love not really cooking if I don't feel like it, here's how to combine the two</p>
        <h2>You will need:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Ground beef</li>
            <li>Half an onion, sliced</li>
            <li>American cheese</li>
            <li>A lot of sauce</li>
            <li>Breadcrumbs</li>
            <li>Herbs and spices</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, mix together the meat, breadcrumbs, herbs and spices and some ketchup.</li>
            <li>Pound that all together with an egg as well, why not. Anyway once that's done shape them into patties.</li>
            <li>Grill those patties in a George Foreman registered trademark grill. Otherwise fry them on a non-George Foreman regular frying pan.</li>
            <li>Toast your buns, put butter on them. Burgers are already unhealthy why skimp on additional flavour</li>
            <li>put the patties in the buns then you're done. Slather a bunch of sauce on it because it will probably not detract from any of the taste</li>
        </ol>
